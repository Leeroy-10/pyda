                        <br><br>
                        <p class="whiteinfotext">Pendle Youth Darts Academy is a non-profitable organisation launched in October
                        2024 by the founders Gary Hooper and Mark Edwards along with the support of our amazing coaches,
                        volunteers and sponsors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The academy aims to promote the Sport of Darts to children and young people who are the future
                        of
                        the sport. The academy enrol both boys and girls from the ages of 8 to 17 years old. We have a three tier 
                        training system based around their experience - the training categories are Novices, Intermediates and Elites. We also hold
                        weekly coaching sessions and have various competitions throughout the year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We currently have 35
                        students on our books with a waiting list of over 20 due to the ever-growing interest in the
                        sport.
                        All funds collected go back into the academy by paying for equipment, competitions, trophies,
                        trips
                        and general running costs.</p>
